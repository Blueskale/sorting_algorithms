ALX SE - Sorting algorithms and Big O Notation

This project explores popular sorting algorithms and using Big O notation to indicate time and space complexity. The aim of this project is to get students comfortable with the basics of sorting algorithms and how to determine the efficiency of the algorithms based on their input size.

The project includes implementations of four sorting algorithms - Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, and Quick sort - for sorting arrays and doubly linked lists. The code is written in C programming language and has been tested using provided test cases.

The following is a summary of the tasks completed in this project:

Mandatory Tasks:

Bubble sort
The first task involved writing a C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm. The function takes an array and its size as input and returns the sorted array. In addition, the Big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm were also written in the 0-O file.

Insertion sort
The second task involved writing a C function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm. The function takes a doubly linked list as input and returns the sorted list. The Big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm were also written in the 1-O file.

Selection sort
The third task involved writing a C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm. The function takes an array and its size as input and returns the sorted array. The Big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm were also written in the 2-O file.

Quick sort
The fourth task involved writing a C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm. The function takes an array and its size as input and returns the sorted array. The Big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm were also written in the 3-O file.

Advanced Tasks:

Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
The fifth task involved writing a C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence. The function takes an array and its size as input and returns the sorted array. The Knuth sequence is used as the sequence of intervals for the Shell sort. In this task, we did not write any Big O notation for the Shell sort algorithm.
All C functions were written according to project specifications and are thoroughly commented for clarity. In addition, we did not use any global variables and avoided using the standard library except where specified.

To compile any of the C files, the following command can be used: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <filename.c> <mainfile.c> -o <outputfile>

Please note that this project was completed in a repository separate from the main ALX SE low-level programming repository
